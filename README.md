I believe the reason I was born is to someday invent a **fantastic algorithm**. Until then, I:
- Build random **cool projects** and enhance them using **AI**.  
- Focus on **automation**, **algorithm design**, and making ideas come alive.  
- Learn and experiment with **optimization techniques**, even when they leave me in tears.
