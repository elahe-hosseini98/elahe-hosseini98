## 🌟 Closing Thoughts

As I navigate the ups and downs of life, I find strength in these words of poetry, reminding me to stand tall in the face of challenges. Here's a beautiful Persian poem with its English translation:

ایستاده‌ام، ایستاده‌ام              | I am standing, I am standing  
به فردایی که خواهد آمد،            | For the tomorrow that will come  
به خورشیدی که پشت ابرهاست         | For the sun hidden behind the clouds  
و به دستانی که خالی نیستند.        | And for hands that are not empty 

اگرچه طوفان خشمگین است،           | Though the storm is fierce  
اگرچه شب تاریک است،               | Though the night is dark  
اما من هنوز می‌دانم،                 | Yet I still know  
که بذر نور                           | That the seeds of light  
در دل هر سیاهی نهفته است.          | Are hidden within every darkness  


🌟 Remember, no matter how challenging the journey becomes, the seeds of light are always there, waiting to bloom.
